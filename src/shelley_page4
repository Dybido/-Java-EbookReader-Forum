   1 I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not abhorred! They were my 
   2 brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt attracted even to the 
   3 most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an angelic nature 
   4 and celestial mechanism. But I felt that I had no right to share 
   5 their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy among them whose joy 
   6 it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans. How they 
   7 would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world did they 
   8 know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their 
   9 source in me!
