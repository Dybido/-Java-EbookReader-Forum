   1 How can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a 
   2 favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness 
   3 and compassion? Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; 
   4 my soul glowed with love and humanity; but am I not alone, 
   5 miserably alone? You, my creator, abhor me; what hope can I 
   6 gather from your fellow creatures, who owe me nothing?
