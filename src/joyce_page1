   1 I will not serve that in which I no longer believe, whether it calls 
   2 itself my home, my fatherland, or my church: and I will try to express 
   3 myself in some mode of life or art as freely as I can and as wholly as 
   4 I can, using for my defense the only arms I allow myself to use -- 
   5 silence, exile, and cunning.
