   1 As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to 
   2 consider the effects of what I was now doing. Three years before, 
   3 I was engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose 
   4 unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it 
   5 forever with the bitterest remorse. I was now about to form 
   6 another being of whose dispositions I was alike ignorant; she 
   7 might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate and 
   8 delight, for its own sake, 
   9 in murder and wretchedness.
