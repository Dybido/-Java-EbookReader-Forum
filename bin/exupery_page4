   1 If I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note 
   2 of its number for you, it is on account of the grown-ups and their 
   3 ways. When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never 
   4 ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you, 
   5 "What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he 
   6 collect butterflies?" Instead, they demand: "How old is he? How many 
   7 brothers has he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father 
   8 make?" Only from these figures do they think they have learned 
   9 anything about him.
