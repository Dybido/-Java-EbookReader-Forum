   1 This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope. That was 
   2 by a Turkish astronomer, in 1909. On making his discovery, the astronomer 
   3 had presented it to the International Astronomical Congress, in a great 
   4 demonstration. But he was in Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe 
   5 what he said. Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, 
   6 a Turkish dictator made a law that his subjects, under pain of death, 
   7 should change to European costume. So in 1920 the astronomer gave his 
   8 demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance. 
   9 And this time everybody accepted his report.
